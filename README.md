# hello-world
This is my first github repository

I'm a confident individual who persevere where hardwork is concerned. My strengths are analyzing what I have learned to strengthen my comprehension and retain information longer. I am a kind of person that when presented with ideas or issues I likely to see the bigger picture because I have learned to think rationally while I detach my feelings on the subject at hand. I have a deeper desire to inspire others to pursue their goals  and dreams so we can all reach for higher purpose in life other than attending to our self-gratifications.
